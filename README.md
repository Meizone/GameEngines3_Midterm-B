PLEASE NOTE: any pushes 10/28/2021 forward are Internal Documentation
being added as a consequence of not looking closely at the internal documentation enough
also the Workcited that was previously on this page was one that was not being updated enough and 
I have updated it to include all the sources I used and what I used said sources for.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.

 - All Workcited, Readme with upfront Major source usage up to date



Please Note:
A lot of of the mentality behind building this code and how the systems were structured
were thanks to CodeMonkeys tutorials:

https://youtu.be/fxaDBE71UHA - Grid Inventory

https://youtu.be/dulosHPl82A - Grid Building


https://github.com/bryangalani/Unity_TetrisInventory 
- Tetris movement in a Single Inventory, did not have a tutorial so
I learned based off of his code myself. This tied all of CodeMonkeys 
Teachings together


He has links to the actual code that he used in his descriptions and I have linked
the two that I personally installed to take a closer look at in the WorkCited.
