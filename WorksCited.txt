    Tetris Inventory System learned to handle the Slotted Grid Interactions


Installed Projects for a more indepth look:

    https://unitycodemonkey.com/video.php?v=dulosHPl82A
- Checked Project Code for a more Indepth search of 
How the Slot system actually worked and how to handle "Slotting" the items
Followed the steps of Bryangalani's Tetris system, helped solidify MonkeyCode
With the Slotted Array with refining the movement in a single Slot Inventory system,
Note that he did not have a tutorial so I had to learn his code Line by Line and
reimplement for a multi-System.

    - Learned about the Unity Event System and how it certain events interact with eachother 
    (Such as, OnDrop and OnEndDrag not working properly due to the CanvasGroup blocking RayCasts, Also 
    thanks to CodeMonkey for also highlighting that)

https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/EventSystems.PointerEventData.html
    - Learned about more Properties around the PointerEventData such as the Position Property to deal with that 
    Issue of having Multiple Canvas's with different scales messing with OnDrag (Presumebly)

   - These were more in General just to help understand how they work more clearly, The video showed that These
   worked but I wasn't sure how they preformed.
